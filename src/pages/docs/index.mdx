# Kodi Documentation

Kodi has two kinds of documentation.

## End User Documentation

[The Kodi wiki](https://kodi.wiki) is the primary location for all user oriented instructions.  It is, in essence, the place to go for "how to" related things.

## Developer Documentation

A vast majority of the [developer documentation](https://docs.kodi.tv) is in doxygen.  This includes skin development and interface documentation for Python (for building most add-ons) and C++ (for PVR and other binary add-ons).  [Information about Kodi's JSON RPC](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API) interface is available in the Kodi wiki.
