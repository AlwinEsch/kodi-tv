        You can help in so many different ways, as you may or may not know, Kodi is
        maintained completely by volunteers and we need and value any contributions
        to the project. If you can code, we are always on the lookout for new team
        members to assist with development. If you are good with your words then you
        can help others in the forum, with QA or translations. If you are time poor
        but still want to give back, then you can donate or purchase some great Kodi
        merch. Visit our contribute page for all the other ways you can help.
