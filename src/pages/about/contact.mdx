## Kodi Support

For regular user support, please use [our community support forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/).

Our forum is a very active community driven site where many fellow users and developers discuss issues, present new addons and will try to answer your questions or help solve problems you may have regarding the usage of Kodi. The forum is divided into several sections each dedicated to certain aspects of the usage of Kodi.

Be sure to read our [forum rules and guidelines](https://kodi.wiki/view/Forum_rules) to allow your journey on the forum to be a smooth and successful one for everyone.

## Corporate Enquiries

### Overview

Kodi is free and open-source software, meaning that it is generally acceptable for any company to use and distribute it as long as our license and trademarks are respected. We as Kodi Foundation do not charge any licensing fees for the usage of our product. A small selection of the possibilities that make our product great are highlighted on our [about page](/about).

The source code that makes Kodi is available for any interested user or company, and can be found at <https://github.com/xbmc>. We encourage non team members to contribute to our code to improve general stability and expand and improve the overall usability.

However, in order to foster a healthy relationship with the Kodi team, we ask that interested parties open a line of communication with us first. This is only a courtesy of course, but we appreciate knowing where our project is used. We may even be able to help you with your plan!

Examples include whether you're using the vanilla version, a slightly-customised version, whether you're looking to expand possible hardware support or add certain features, and so on.

If you would like to discuss your project in more depth, please contact us at interest(AT)kodi.tv and describe the project and its scope as much as possible. We are always happy to work with companies who wish to include us in their projects.

### Sponsorship

Sponsorship can come in many forms. Some examples of donations and sponsorships include promoting the usage our product by displaying it at conventions, providing needed hardware to develop on or for our backend server infrastructure and donating a certain amount of funds. These can all help maintain our current goals and to expand the current possibilities or support new platforms, and financial sponsorship may be tax-deductable.

We also provide the option for companies to become [official sponsors](/about/sponsors) (see the sponsors banner on our front page). In addition to the satisfaction of helping the open-source community, sponsors are entitled to some special perks as well. We strongly encourage anyone using Kodi as part of their business model to sponsor us in some way, though you are welcome to keep the details private if you wish.

Please understand that we cannot give legal advice regarding your possible implementation of our software. Multimedia licensing/copyrights/patents are very tricky, please contact a software attorney for help with these questions.

If you would like to discuss these aspects in more depth, please contact us at interest(AT)kodi.tv so we can work out any possible details.
