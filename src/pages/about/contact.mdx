## Corporate Enquiries

### Overview

Kodi is free and open-source software, meaning that it is generally acceptable for any company to use and distribute it as long as our license is respected. We as Kodi Foundation do not charge any licensing fees for the usage of our product. A small selection of the possibilities that make our product great are highlighted on our [about page](/about).

The source code that makes Kodi is open for any user or company interested, and can be found at <https://github.com/xbmc>. We encourage non team members to contribute to our code to improve general stability and expand and improve the overall usability.

However, in order to foster a healthy relationship with the Kodi team, we ask that interested parties open a line of communication with us first. This is only a courtesy of course, but we appreciate knowing where our project is used. We may even be able to help you with your plan! Examples include whether you're using the vanilla version, a slightly-customised version, whether you're looking to expand possible hardware support or add certain features, and so on.

If you would like to discuss your project in more depth, please contact us at interest(AT)kodi.tv and describe the project and its scope as much as possible. We are always happy to work with companies who wish to include us in their projects.

### Sponsorship

Sponsorship can come in many forms. Promoting the usage our product by displaying it at conventions, providing needed hardware to develop on, expand current possibilities or support new platforms or donating a certain amount of funds to help maintain our current goals.

We also provide the option for companies to become [official sponsors](/about/sponsors) (see the sponsors banner on our front page). In addition to the satisfaction of helping the open-source community, sponsors are entitled to some special perks as well. We strongly encourage anyone using XBMC as part of their business model to sponsor us in some way, though you are welcome to keep the details private if you wish.

Please understand that we cannot give legal advice regarding your possible implementation of our software. Multimedia licensing/copyrights/patents are very tricky, please contact a software attorney for help with these questions.

If you would like to discuss these aspects in more depth, please contact us at interest(AT)kodi.tv so we can work out any possible details.
