## Introduction

The following is a list of organizations that, to the best of XBMCâ€™s knowledge, have released versions of XBMC without the source code required by the GPL v2.0. As we are much more interested in opening up code than taking any kind of legal action, we have decided to follow the lead of FFMPEG and others by merely listing these organizations.

If any organization on this list is interested in rehabilitating and getting their name cleared, feel free to contact XBMC at contact (at) xbmc dot org. Once we can document the availability of source code, we will happily remove your name from the list.

## Known GPL Violators

The list is looking good!
