# What is the Kodi Foundation?

The “Kodi Foundation” is the non-profit organization that operates the Kodi project by handling monetary as well as IP-related issues. The Kodi Foundation is a non-profit organization, registered in the US.

## Members

Membership of the Kodi Foundation is typically taken from members of Team Kodi, but may include non Team members.
The Kodi Board of Directors are Foundation members that manages the Kodi Foundation. The Board consists of five seats that are chosen by vote from the Kodi Foundation members. The Board’s responsibilities include management of funds, publicity, and all business related issues (taxes, communication with other businesses, maintaining non-profit status etc.)

The Board meets about once a month (in addition to any special meetings as required) to discuss any business that needs to be handled by the foundation. Meetings are typically conducted via teleconference using a service such as Skype.

## What is expected of an Kodi Board member?

Board members are expected to attend all meetings or will otherwise be diligent in letting the other board members know if they won’t be around. Further, they’ll be expected to make decisions (as a group) in the best interests of the foundation. The Board is accountable to the members, so should consider recommendations made by members during the decision making process, though they ultimately must make the final decisions. Any and all discussion should be frankly communicated to members within a reasonable time frame.

## Who can be an Kodi Board member?

Any existing member of the foundation, as voted by the remaining members.

## How long does a board member hold office?

Terms last for two years. We endeavor to have a staggered cycle so that not all board members are turned over at a single election. There are no term restrictions, so Board members may even run for consecutive terms. However, in the interests of sharing the load, any and all members are encouraged to participate.

## Who elects the officers?

The board elects the officers. In doing so, they may choose to take advice from the membership, but the decision is theirs. The President must be from within the board itself, though Secretary, Treasurer, and any other officers the board wishes to appoint may be from outside the board (or outside the membership).
How do Board elections operate?

Board elections occur as follows:

* A member is nominated by the Board to oversee the election.
* Nominations for the open positions are taken from within the existing membership via email and/or via a forum thread. This lasts a total of no less than 7 days.
* Anyone nominated is placed on the ballot.
* A vote of the membership is then taken using a trusted internet voting service using a ranking system. (usually via the Condorcet Internet Voting Service, <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/w8/~andru/civs> ) and the candidates with the highest ranks take office. This vote lasts a minimum of 7 days.
