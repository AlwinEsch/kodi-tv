# Becoming an Kodi Foundation Sponsor

Kodi is a fairly expensive operation to maintain, and as such, we are always happy to welcome new sponsors to the fold, as additional sponsorships tend to make it easier to further development and spread the word. To become an Kodi Foundation sponsor, any organization may simply contact the Kodi Foundation at contact (AT) kodi.tv.

With that said, the Kodi Foundation remains a non-profit organization, and as such, we would like very much to combine simple financial growth with definite software and community growth. Keeping that in mind, we ask that all potential sponsors answer the following brief questions in their contact email:

1. In a paragraph, could you tell us a bit about your organization?
1. Why would you like to become an Kodi Foundation sponsor?
1. What efforts have you made, if any, to advance Open Source Software generally and Kodi specifically?
1. What level of XBMC Sponsorship are  you interested in?
