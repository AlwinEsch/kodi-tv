# A Note on Hardware

Kodi Foundation does not sell hardware, either on eBay or anywhere else. With that said, several organizations or manufacturers do sell hardware with XBMC or Kodi in mind. Team XBMC/Kodi and the Kodi Foundation does not promote the use of one piece of hardware over any other.

# A Note on Development and other Kodi Foundation-related News

The only place to receive official news from Team XBMC/Kodi and the Kodi Foundation regarding Kodi development is via [kodi.tv](/). There are numerous great fan-created and even team member-created sites out there that also focus on providing XBMC-related content and info. These other sites should be considered unofficial and do not represent the Kodi Foundation or Team XBMC/Kodi. If you are uncertain as to whether a piece of news is official, don’t hesitate to email [contact@kodi.tv](mailto:contact@kodi.tv).
