# Let us entertain you!

Kodi spawned from the love of media. It is media center and entertainment hub that brings all your digital media together into a beautiful and user friendly package. It is 100% free and open source, very customisable and runs on a wide variety of devices. It is supported by a dedicated team of volunteers and a huge community.

Kodi is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, tvOS and Android. It is designed around a "10-foot user interface" for use with televisions and remote controls.

Users can play and view most videos, music, podcasts, games and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet.
