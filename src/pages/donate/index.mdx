# Donate to Kodi

Donations are used solely for purchasing hardware to improve and extend the goals of the Kodi Foundation, travel for conferences, and administrative costs and fees. We ask that if you find the software useful and would like to support our efforts, please consider donating what you think the software is worth. You can donate using one of following options:

## Donor Recognition

Everyone who donates **$50US** (or **â‚¬40**) or more may be recognized as an official Kodi Foundation donor in the forums. 

## Recurring Donations

Recurring Donations are intentionally smaller amounts that can be counted toward Kodi Foundation Donor+ status. They automatically renew every month unless you cancel your subscription. We are currently using Patreon for automatic recurring subscriptions, but if you do smaller donations throughout the year via some other means, once you get to $50, please send us the receipts so you can be recognized.

## Sponsorships

Has Kodi improved your business? You can give back to the project by becoming a diamond or gold sponsor.
