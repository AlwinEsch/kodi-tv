## How can I help make Kodi better?

Kodi Foundation products are for the users and created by the users. There are no highly paid developers or poorly paid support personnel on the phones ready to take your call. There are only users who have seen a problem and done their best to fix it. This means the Kodi Foundation will always need the contributions of users like you. How can you get involved?

### Helping Users

Our support process relies on enthusiastic contributors like you to help others get the most out of Kodi Foundation products. The #1 priority is always answering questions in our support forums. Everyday new people discover a Kodi Foundation product, and everyday they are virtually guaranteed to have questions. If you are knowledgeable in a certain area in one of our products, or simply want to try help others, we highly encourage you to field questions in the forums.
