## User Forum

Kodi has an active user forum that is frequented by members of Team Kodi as well as many of the most active and knowledge users of our software. If you need help, [the forum is a great first place to stop](https://forum.kodi.tv).

## Kodi Documentation

Kodi has two kinds of documentation.

### End User Documentation

[The Kodi wiki](https://kodi.wiki) is the primary location for all user oriented instructions.  It is, in essence, the place to go for "how to" related things.

### Developer Documentation

A vast majority of the [developer documentation](https://docs.kodi.tv) is in doxygen.  This includes skin development and interface documentation for Python (for building most add-ons) and C++ (for PVR and other binary add-ons).  [Information about Kodi's JSON RPC](https://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API) interface is available in the Kodi wiki.
