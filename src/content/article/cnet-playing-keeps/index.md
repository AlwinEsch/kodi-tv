cnet has today posted the first in a three-day report about the multimedia capabilities of todays and future game consoles, including the use of xbmc/xbmp on the xbox. cnet is/was the popular technology news website that contacted us a couple of weeks ago about interviewing a xbmp end-user on camera and that video interview is part of this report, quote: *“game industry leads race for digital ‘uberdevice’*“. so head over to cnet news.com and check it out the first piece, “strategy: outside the box” and watch the video (with steven, a san francisco student), you also get the full three-day report right now in pdf format if you register with cnet (which is free) otherwise you have to wait two more days to read all three pieces.
