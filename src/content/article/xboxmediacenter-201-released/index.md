[Team-XBMC](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Team_XBMC_and_Others) and [The XBMC Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/) is proud to announce the release of XboxMediaCenter 2.0.1. [XBox Media Center (XBMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC) is an [award winning](https://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/), free and open source media player for the [Xbox™ game-console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox). XboxMediaCenter 2.0.1 point-release [source code](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_Is_Source_Code) has now been set in our [CVS](https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87054), and all XBMC users are highly encouraged to upgrade to this version. Know that this point-release version marks the end of the 2.0 era of XBMC, there will be no more 2.0.x bug-fix point-releases. The next point-release of XBMC will be 2.1 (or maybe even 3.0), and it will probably be quite a while before that 2.1 (or 3.0) version sees the light of day with all new major features/functions we have planned for the future, (those who can not wait can always use the latest daily CVS of XBMC).

 This XboxMediaCenter 2.0.1 point-release is a stable bug-fix version of the [XboxMediaCenter 2.0.0 point-release](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?pid=110888%23pid110888), no major new features has been implemented, for a full list of fixed bugs and tweaks please read the [changelog](http://xbmc.cvs.sourceforge.net/xbmc/XBMC/Changelog.txt?revision=1.3178&view=markup&sortby=date). (For a full list of all features/functions and codecs/formats supported by XBMC please visit the “[XBMC Features and Supported Formats/Codecs](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=XBMC_Features_and_Supported_Formats/Codecs)” page in our [online manual](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Xbox_Media_Center_Online_Manual)). Remember, [Team-XBMC](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Team_XBMC_and_Others) only maintain the XBMC [source code](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_Is_Source_Code), [Team-XBMC](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Team_XBMC_and_Others) does not release or distribute [Xbox executable (XDK binaries)](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_Xbox_SDK), but the XBMC [source code](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_Is_Source_Code) needs to be compiled with the [XDK](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_Xbox_SDK) before it can be used on an [Xbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox), also note that XBMC requires a modded Xbox to run. Our thanks goes out to everyone who has tested, reported bugs, and helped fix them in order to make this release possible.

 Help is always wanted to keep our [online-manual](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [language translations files](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Information_on_Language_Support) up-to-date.
