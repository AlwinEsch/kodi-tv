After the [recent post](/article/xbmc-growing-gains-cool-new-services) introducing our new build services and content delivery system, the response from users wishing to help out has been quite impressive. I wanted to quickly follow-up with another ‘thank you’ to the community that never ceases to amaze. Seven mirrors have since been added to the rotation (see [here](http://mirrors.xbmc.org/list.html) for a current list), and Fedora and openSUSE buildslaves have just been added to the buildbot. Thank you to Nate Davis with Med One Capital for these. Currently we will not be providing rpms, but just having them built nightly goes a long way towards making sure that our code works on as many distributions as possible. The nightly compiles will also help us to work more closely with distro maintainers, and ease the process of being added to official repositories.

 I am still working to get back to everyone who has contacted us with offers to contribute, but I am finally almost caught up. Keep em coming!
