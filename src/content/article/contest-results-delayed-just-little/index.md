Hey all, this is only a brief note. As you know, we are currently hosting a contest for a new XBMC mascot, and the results of that contest were supposed to be finished and announced today. Unfortunately (or fortunately), our community went absolutely above and beyond the call of duty and submitted an incredible number of [really awesome mascots](http://xbmc.exstatic.org/mascots/ "really awesome mascots").

 At one point, a Team member suggested we just take the top six, because the selection was so difficult. Unfortunately, it really wouldn’t have made much sense to have six different mascots, so we are going through a couple rounds of narrowing the list to reach our top three first, second, and third place, per the [contest rules](https://kodi.wiki/natethomas/2011/05/02/mascot-contest/ "mascot rules").

 Regrettably, this has resulted in a brief delay on our part, as we do our best to select the best winner we can, but final voting is occurring as we speak, and a winner will be announced on Friday. So keep an eye out.

 And in the mean time, good job artists! You’ve done an absolutely incredible job!
