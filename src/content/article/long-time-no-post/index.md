 Sorry about that, I havenâ€™t been able to blog about any updates in a while, someone came wrong with the system.  
 Hopefully I can keep you all up to date on my workings.  
 Stay tuned for the next release!

 **In the meanwhile keep in mind that these instructions cover LiveXBMC-V1 and are missing some bits here and there when referring to V2 (V2 was not released at that time)!  
 However, the image creation processes steps still apply.**
