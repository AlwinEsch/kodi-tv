It’s that time again. After an extremely productive DevCon where we hammered out some nasty bugs, we’re proud to announce Dharma Release Candidate 1.

 Major fixes since Beta4:

 
 * A fix for a problem when pausing/seeking. This was known to cause static or erratic behavior on some amplifiers.
 * Beta4 introduced a regression with Linux and Live users that led to broken or choppy playback. Please note that anyone upgrading to RC1 on these platforms is highly advised to remove ~/.asoundrc, and create a new one if you had done so previously.
 * The Bootable LiveCD script is now much more reliable. What a great way to install to a flash drive!
 
 And a few new features:

 
 * After adding a source, you are now prompted to set content. This should be much more logical for new users.
 * New icons for the addon browser.
 
 We are nearing release… [Download RC1 now](http://mirrors.xbmc.org/releases/) and keep the good reports coming. Let’s get Final out the door!
