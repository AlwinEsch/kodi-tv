MiniMeedia has now been added to the Official XBMC Skinning Project SVN so that anyone can now download the project files (including all the textures etc). You can find out more details about the XBMC Skinning Project [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xboxmediacenter/).

 The code added to SVN is the same as the 0.95 version that was released last month with a couple of small tweaks to the languages folder and a new linux build script (untested).

 I may finally be getting some time to look at polishing the skin and getting the v1.00 release ready over the next few days and weeks.
