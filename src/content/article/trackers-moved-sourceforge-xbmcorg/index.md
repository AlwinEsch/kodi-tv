With our recent move to host the xbmc.org website on our own webserver, Team-XBMC have now also taken steps to setup [our own tracker-system for XBMC](http://trac.xbmc.org/) using [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/). Consequently, our previous trackers, which were hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/), has been closed and all bugs, patches and feature request tickets have been migrated to the new tracker-system under [trac](http://trac.xbmc.org).

 Integrating this tracker-system into our site allowed us to implement a unified login, so from now on, only a single registration is required. [Register](https://forum.kodi.tv/register.php) on the forums, if you have not already, to be able to post both in the [forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/) and to new or existing tickets on [trac](http://trac.xbmc.org/).

 This is the first step towards making it easier for all XBMC users to report bugs, request features, submit language translations and code patches. Team-XBMC now accept bug-reports and feature-requests for [XBMC for Linux](https://kodi.wiki/download/), [XBMC for Mac](https://kodi.wiki/download/), [XBMC for Windows](https://kodi.wiki/download/), as well as [XBMC for Xbox](https://kodi.wiki/download/). Note though that for bugs please try post in [the respective platform bug discussion forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/) first to get it replicated and confirmed by someone else too.

 Team-XBMC would also like to take this opportunity to thank [XanTium of Xbox-Scene](http://www.xbox-scene.com) for hosting the XBMC website on his webserver up until now.
