We the members of The XBMC Project hope you all have a great holiday, (no matter if you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa), we wish everyone a happy new year! The XBMC (XBox Media Center) Project will of course continue on next year, hopefully stronger than ever with another platform officially supported sometime during this upcoming year. We also hope that a new year will mean that more new developers will join the XBMC project, as always we keep we are getting more and more feature requests and new ideas every day, and we never seem to have enough developers/time to fulfil them all. So we say the more the merrier, ideas, people, and help. Come on and join our community you too, together we can make XBMC reach new potential!

 Best wishes / Team-XBMC
