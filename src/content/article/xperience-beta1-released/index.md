Itâ€™s been a busy week for skins: first [Transparency!](/article/transparency-v211-released), then Xperience. As promised in their [teaser video](/article/xperience-teaser) a few weeks back, team Blackbolt has unveiled Beta1 of their NXE-inspired skin. Of course, it requires the fancy new Camelot version of XBMC. You can grab the skin [here](http://rapidshare.com/files/326770461/Xperience_Beta_One.zip), and head to the [release thread](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=65106) for discussion.
