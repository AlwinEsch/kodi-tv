This promotional video has been linked several times in the XBMC IRC channels in the last few days so it seemed appropriate to post here (it gets good at about 3:00). Itâ€™s flattering to see that the manufacturers have taken notice of our project, and even seem to have it in mind when designing their hardware. Zotac has also furnished us with some equipment for testing and input from our developers, so it seems that they have a genuine interest in improving the XBMC experience. It would be great if more companies made an effort to work with open-source projects in this manner.
