Heya fellow net dwellers,

Right now the [Remote Chaos Experience (RC3)](https://rc3.world/) is already running at full steam as virtual replacement for the 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) that was supposed to be held in Leipzig, Germany, at exactly this time.

While we did not register an official assembly, some Team Kodi members are roaming around the RC3 world and we will use the opportunity to hold a short **"What's new" presentation** plus Q&A session on the last day of the congress. The exact date and time is **Wednesday, 30th December, 2 p.m. CET**.

The event is over and the recording is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5rG_BFA-U6o).
