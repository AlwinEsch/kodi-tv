[tom’s hardware guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/) (probably the most famous computer hardware site on the internet) has posted a very brief article about the most current standalone *“multi-talented multi-media”* appliances for the living room. it shortly compares the multimedia capabilities of northq nq5000, kiss dp-500, cd3o c300 and an [xbox](https://www.xbox.com/) running [xbox media player](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.com) with the conclusion that *“the scope of functions offered by a modified xbox has little or no competition”*. sadly they misquoted a price of $289 (€300) for a modded xbox which will give people a false impression, as today you can practically mod an xbox for free via software, alternatively there are always cheap modchips what will do the trick for under $20. in the end one is left imagining what the people at [tom’s hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/) would have to say if they wrote a full review of [xbmc](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com) instead of [xboxmediaplayer](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.com), (as our successor of [xbmp](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.com), [xbox media center](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com) has already surpassed it’s predecessor in more ways than one)
