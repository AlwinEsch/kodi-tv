darkie has done an amazing job by porting [samba](https://www.samba.org/) 3.0.1 to the xbox. he threw away the old and very buggy smb (libsmb++) implementation in xbmc and replaced it with his new port of [samba](https://www.samba.org/) 3.0.1. this means that from now on xbmc is using the same samba implementation as smb under linux does. hopefully this solves all smb related problems which has troubled xbmc for so long. please note that the smb notation in xboxmediacenter.xml has now changed a little bit!

 seems this new year begins very good. thanx a lot darkie!
