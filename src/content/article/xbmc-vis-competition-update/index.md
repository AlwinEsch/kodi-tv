we got some bad news and we got some good news, depending how you look on it. the bad news is team-xecuter has let us know that the x3 has been slightly delayed so we wonâ€™t have any prizes to hand out directly when the contest where about to end so we have decided to postpone the competition. the good news is that team-xecuter said they will still guarantee the prizes to the winners so we will only postpone the last submission date of the contest one month to the 18th of april 2004. this means more time for more developers to code and hand in their visualizations, so we hope that more xbox, homebrew and visualisation programmers will step up and show us what they got.
