[Team-XBMC](/about/team) is proud to announce the second cross-platform Beta version of [XBMC Media Center](https://kodi.wiki/view/Main_Page) for Linux, Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger, and Apple TV), Windows, and Xbox, in preparation for the upcoming point release of XBMC, code named ‘[Atlantis](http://trac.xbmc.org/roadmap)‘.

 New in this release is multi-core video decoding for Windows users, courtesy of a rebuilt FFmpeg by WiSo and AreaScout, and [XBMC now runs on the Apple TV](/article/whats-xbmc-mac-running-appletv) via the easy to use USB installer created by Scott Davilla. We have also updated the skins (PM3.HD, Project Mayhem III, and [MediaStream](https://www.seventech.org) by Team Razorfish) to their latest versions.

 With [almost 80 tickets closed](http://trac.xbmc.org/milestone/8.10), and [close to 200 commits to SVN](http://trac.xbmc.org/timeline) since Beta 1 was released, Beta 2 represents a clear step forward in terms of stability. Thanks to all in the community who have made this possible by reporting bugs and suggesting improvements!

 Go [grab XBMC ‘Atlantis’ Beta 2](https://kodi.wiki/download/) and let us know how it goes!

 Yours sincerely / Team-XBMC
