The results are in and unfortunately we didn’t take home any awards from the SourceForge Community Choice Awards. That’s a shame, because we really had our eyes on that Best Multimedia title… but there’s always next year. Congratulations to all projects that were nominated, and doubly to the winners. We consider it a great honor to have even been nominated in as many categories as we were, so thanks again to all who voted.

 As always, the XBMC team and our great community are hard at work making the best Media Center app on the planet. Keep checking back for the latest features and updates; it gets better every day.
