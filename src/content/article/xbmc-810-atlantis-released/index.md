[Team-XBMC](/about/team) is proud to announce the cross-platform release of [XBMC Media Center](https://kodi.wiki/view/Main_Page) version 8.10 for Linux, Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger, and Apple TV), Windows, and Xbox, code named ‘[Atlantis](http://trac.xbmc.org/roadmap)‘.

 We have reached the end of over 3-months of bug bashing, and have closed 425 tickets for this Gold version release and, while there are [still some bugs outstanding](http://trac.xbmc.org/browser/branches/8.10_Atlantis-linux-osx-win32/XBMC/known_issues.txt), we feel that ‘Atlantis’ is reasonably stable, and thus it is time to move on and get cracking on new features. We have branched for release, and will maintain this branch with critical bug fixes while we move on and begin working on new features in the main linuxport SVN trunk.

 Thanks goes to everyone in the XBMC community who have made this possible by reporting bugs and suggesting improvements. In particular we’d like to recognise the sterling efforts of Sigurdur Olafsson (a.k.a. Sho) who has been acting release manager for ‘Atlantis’, diligently handling the tracking system on behalf of developers. We would also like to thank Arnova, SandmanCL and ShortySco of our new Quality Assurance Team for their help verifying bug reports and making it easier for the developers to concentrate on fixing bugs.

 Go [grab XBMC ‘Atlantis’](https://kodi.wiki/download/) and let us know how it goes!

 Yours sincerely / Team-XBMC
