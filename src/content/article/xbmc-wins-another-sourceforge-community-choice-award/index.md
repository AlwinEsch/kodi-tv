[XBMC media center](https://kodi.wiki/view/Main_Page) was nominated as a finalist in this years [SourceForge Community Choice Awards (CCA)](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca08/) in no less than seven categories, including “*Most Likely to Change the World*” (awarded to [Linux](https://www.linux.org/)) and “*Best Project for Multimedia*” (awarded to [VLC](http://www.videolan.org)). The winners were announced at a [party held as part of OSCON](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/) and XBMC won the award for “*Best Project for Gamers*“. The “*Best Project*” award went to [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org) (which was overall winner taking home three awards in total).

 XBMC started life out as the central piece of media center software for the old Xbox games console, and it is great to receive this recognition as the media center that gamers enjoy and use.

 Over the last 12 months or so we have been branching out to all platforms, so that XBMC now also runs natively on Linux, Mac and Windows. We hope with a couple of stable releases under our belt (expect some news about this shortly) that more and more people will be using XBMC on their platform of choice.

 Team-XBMC would like to thank [SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/) and everyone who took the time to vote for XBMC in this year’s SourceForge Community Choice Awards.
