the day many of you have been waiting for has finally come; xbmcâ€™s built-in dvd-player core is now officially open to the public for general usage. the new dvdplayer-core, which a few of our developers have been working on for almost a year has been enabled in our cvs and is of today the default player for dvd-video playback in xbmc. please be patient with it, understand that it can be a bit buggy, it has some limitations, and still needs a lot of work. the basics functions for dvd-video playback (dvd-menus support) is in there and from now on we will accept ([properly formatted](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_faq.htm#28)) bug-reports from end-users and we will do our best to help users of the player. we would also like to take this moment to ask and encourage programmers who may or may not yet have contributed to the xbmc project to step up and assist in the development of this new core for dvd-video playback. please take a look at the source code, its potential, and then look at the many (big and small) features that are missing or lacking, there are things that almost anyone can help with.

 a special thanks goes to all people and groups who made a donatation!
