If you enjoy the command prompt in Linux/OS X as much as I do, then I hope you’ve been aquainted with screen. If not, think of it like tabs in your browser. Except now you can go to a different computer and pull up your browser with all those same tabs already opened. The one thing that sucks about screen is that you can’t scroll up to see the history. This makes it difficult if a bunch of shit is being dumped to the terminal and you need to look through it. Well, it turns out that it does exist, and it’s way more awesome then I ever could have imagined. It’s got a search feature! Interested? Read up on it [here](https://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/).
