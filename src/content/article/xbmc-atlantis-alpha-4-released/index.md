Due to the great feedback from [Alpha 3](/upcoming-xbmc-atlantis-release-feature-freeze-updated) users in terms of bug reports, [many of which have already been fixed](http://trac.xbmc.org/milestone/8.10), Team-XBMC have released the latest Alpha version of XBMC for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and Xbox. This is the last in a [series of alpha releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle) in preparation for the upcoming stable release of XBMC, [code named ‘Atlantis’](../../gamester17/?p=3).

 XBMC ‘Atlantis’ is still in a [feature freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_%28software_engineering%29) and the final version is planned to be released on Linux, Mac, Windows, and Xbox in October. You may track the development progress [here](http://trac.xbmc.org/milestone/8.10), with the next release scheduled to be the first Beta.

 We need your help in order to make ‘Atlantis’ as stable as possible. Please [download and use](https://kodi.wiki/download/) this latest Alpha release instead of XBMC SVN builds. We encourage all users to test it thoroughly and [report all bugs](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO_Submit_a_Proper_Bug_Report) to our tracking-system.

 We would also appreciate any and all assistance in making sure that the [XBMC Online Manual](https://kodi.wiki/view/XBMC_Online_Manual) and [FAQ](https://kodi.wiki/view/Frequently_Asked_Questions) are as up to date as possible. Both the manual and FAQ are wiki based so just register and request write access if you wish to contribute. In addition, [translations and updates of XBMC language files](https://kodi.wiki/view/Information_on_Language_Support) is another area where help would be appreciated.

 We expect to be inviting some official beta testers on to the team in the next few weeks, so get testing if you wish to be considered for this role – we’ll be looking for people submitting good quality bug reports for these positions.

 Yours sincerely / Team-XBMC
