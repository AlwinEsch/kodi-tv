If you have been running XBMC 9.04 until now, it must have been a big disappointment that you couldn’t check out all the new skins, as every one of them required you to install an unstable XBMC svn version. Luckily, with the release of XBMC 9.11 Camelot, this has come to an end. With the 9.11 release you’ll not only be able to enjoy all of the new features xbmc has to offer, but there’s also a multitude of new skins to check out. To name a few, there’s ***Confluence*** (the new default skin), ***Ellipsis*** & ***Xperience*** (by team Blackbolt), ***Rapier*** (made by scarfa) and ***Alaska*** (created by djh\_ & Hitcher). Be sure to check them out, they all deserve your attention. ***Transparency!*** is also one of the skins released after XBMC 9.04, so chances are you’ve never used it before.

 Today sees the release of Transparency! v2.11. Have a look at the [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/v/bLlUiYhPQLU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;autoplay=1) to find out what’s it all about, or check the [**xbmc skin section**](/article/transparency-v200-released) for screenshots and a list of features included in this skin. If you want to get involved, head on over to the [**forum**](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=115). I’m always interested in new ideas and could use some help in getting the skin translated to several languages.

 Finally, a big thanx to the entire xbmc community for all the help i’ve received over the past 6 months  
 and, of course, my congratulations to Team-XBMC with the release of 9.11 Camelot!
