 Due to the recent surge of downloads I see the need to reveal some details of the next release that will come out in June:

 
 * XBMC will be upgradeable via the official XBMC PPAs!
 * it will automount all local hard disk partition
 * it will support writing to NTFS via NTFS-3G
 * it will include a boot menu allowing to choose the GPU type among the supported ones – no need to rename files on the USB disk
 * it will include sshd by default to ease debugging and updates.
 * it will support removable media auto-mounting via XBMC build-in capabilities
 
 Don’t hold your breath, the release date is not set yet!

 Cheers
