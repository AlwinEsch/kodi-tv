If you are curious about what *sexy* new features XBMC developers are (not sooo secretly) working on, you might find the following links to our forum enlightening:

 *Please note that most of these threads are development discussions and should therefore be kept at a technical level!*

 
 * [Webkit integration](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=55093) (motd2k)
 * [DirectX port](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=53881&amp;amp;amp%3bpage=2) (elisemory from Boxee)
 * [ARM port](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=35139&amp;amp;amp%3bpage=9) (mcgeagh)
 * [PVR integration](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=28918&amp;amp;amp%3bpage=15) (alcoheca and alwinus)
 * [Video library redesign](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=51605) (jmarshall)
 
 Some of these (sub)projects have their own branch on the XBMC subversion repository (check out [trac](http://trac.xbmc.org/browser/branches)) while being in development.

 Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that there is a new XBMC forum dedicated to ‘[supplemental tools](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=116)‘ i.e. tools developed by our users which interact in some shape or form with XBMC.  
*Note: Team XBMC does not officially support (and in some cases endorse) these tools!*

 If you can contribute in any way to these or developments or other parts of the XBMC code base, I’d encourage you to do so. What’s more rewarding than improving the life of thousands of Media addicts?
