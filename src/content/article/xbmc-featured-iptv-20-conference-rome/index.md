On October the 15th an important conference on “The role of open standards and free software in bringing the choice of Net TV To Italians’ sofas” was held at the University “La Sapienza” in Rome, see the [event page](http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en/project/14/event-ip-tv-net-tv) for more information (and videos!).

 In that context I had the pleasure to present XBMC to a mainly non-technical audience, nonetheless very interested in hearing and seeing something that was totally unexpected and “futuristic” for some aspects.

 Nice experience, many thanks to the Telematics Freedom Foundation for their support.
