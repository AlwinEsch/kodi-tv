again we’re sorry to see an xbox developer which forgot about the gpl license. this time its the ‘complex tools’ application which according to the author uses our port samba 3.01. off course we’re very happy to see that our libraries are used by other developers but remember that both our software and in this case samba too are licensed under gpl. this means that the ‘complex tools’ developer should provide the sources of his application if they are using any of our source code, we hope that they just forgot about it this and will adhere to the gpl license.
