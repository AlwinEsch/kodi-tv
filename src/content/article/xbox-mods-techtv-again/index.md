this saturday and upcomming week on [techtv](https://www.esquire.com/) (starting saturday 10/18-2003 at 10 p.m. eastern):   
*“mod your xbox. see how modders are adding functionality to the popular gaming console. by kevin rose. why mod the xbox? well, the xbox is more than just a gaming machine. it’s the most powerful computer you can purchase for $199. under the hood, the xbox is equipped with a 733-mhz intel pentium iii processor, an nvidia graphics subsystem, hard drive, ethernet, and four usb ports. modding the xbox turns it from a gaming console into a fully functional pc that can still run games. tonight i’ll show you the first step: installing a mod chip.”*

 there is no mentioning if this is rerun of the [five episode series that was shown on the screensavers in march/april earlier this year](https://www.esquire.com/) or if it’s a new follow-up series, however it looks to be a rerun which would give those of you who missed it the first time around a second chance, (they showed of xboxmediaplayer 2.3 point release in the forth episode). but if this is a new follow-up series hope they show latest cvs builds of xbmp and xbmc. ps! you can today get a better deal that $199 on a new xbox, exampel from amazon [$179.99](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b00008h2iy/qid=1066211404)/[£119.99](https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/asin/b00005rhqt/026-2845156-7917263)/[€199.99](https://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/asin/b00009l4p1/ref=ed_xblurb_vg_1_0/302-3462437-1596020), and this price is likely to drop by around 30% within a month from now.
