just a reminder to all other (xbox) developers out there; **please pay respect the gnu general public license (gpl). you can freely use any of the sources of xbmc and/or xbmp in your own project but remember that both xbmc and xbmp are open source under the gpl license.** this means you must follow this license and provide the sources of your application on request. an example of this is [dvd2xbox](http://dvd2xbox.xbox-scene.com), they are using xbmp’s sources but [dvd2xbox](http://dvd2xbox.xbox-scene.com) was closed source itself. i’m very happy the authors of [dvd2xbox](http://dvd2xbox.xbox-scene.com) discovered this themselves and decided to [opensource dvd2xbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dvd2xbox/) but there probably many other (xbox) homebrew applications which are using xbmp/xbmc sources. to all those other software authors i would like to say; please respect the gpl license!!!

 thanx / frodo
