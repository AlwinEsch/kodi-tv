XBMC runs on many platforms and everyone has their favourites, but ever wondered which is the most popular?

 Take a look at the chart below to find out (based on audio universal scraper usage*). Currently Microsoft Windows makes up over half of the XBMC user base but this is shrinking with the rise of easy Linux installs such as [OpenELEC](https://openelec.tv/). Weâ€™ve also seen a large increase in [Raspberry Pi](https://openelec.tv/get-openelec) users in the last few months. It seems many people like the idea of using a cheap bit of hardware as a home theatre device.

 * The [data was collected](https://www.theaudiodb.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1718&amp;p=1718) from 24 days of music requests from <https://www.theaudiodb.com/> so its not a reflection of the entire XBMC ecosystem, just people requesting music metadata. The last time we checked our add-on statistics, we had around 1.9 million active installs around the world.
