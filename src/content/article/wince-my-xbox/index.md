i couldnt believe my eyes when i read the story on [www.xbox-scene.com](http://www.xbox-scene.com). some guy claiming to run windows ce.net on his xbox. i rushed home, downloaded the file, installed it and…. oh my god it worked. i could start windows media player, run ms-word, view powerpoint, etc. sure its not perfect yet and there’s a long road ahead of things to solve. but this is the first time a windows os booted natively on my xbox, (well except the xbox-kernel of course). i hope the developer(s) who made this possible find the time and spirit to develop this further and maybe next year we’re all running windows xp embedded on our xboxes ![:-)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_smile.gif)
