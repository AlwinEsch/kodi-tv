hi all you translators out there,

 this tool is exclusively made for you. ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif) since i (bobbin007) am one of the maintainers of the german language file, i thought it would be time to simplify the whole process of updating a language file a little. after a lot of pondering and hacking, i proudly present the first version of my xbmc translator. hope this tool will be useful as it is now, but as always iâ€™m open for suggestions.

 feature list:  
 - create new translations  
 - keep track of untranslated strings  
 - keep track of changed strings  
 - search function to find strings easily  
 - edit language specific settings, like codepages and date/time format  
 - the language file is saved with **utf-8 encoding**

 [download here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/files/)

 have fun

 bobbin007
