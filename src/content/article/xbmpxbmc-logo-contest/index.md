Maybe some of you have noticed that there is one important thing missing for xbmp and xbmc projects. you’re right, a decent logo, well a logo at all as our project has amazingly never had a real official logo! so we’ve decided to hold this open logo contest. we need an official logo to use on our website, an official skin and wherever a logo could be placed. now unlike most of our other contests this one will not have prize award to be won, except for the pride and honour of knowing that you made ‘the official xbmp/xbmc logos’.
