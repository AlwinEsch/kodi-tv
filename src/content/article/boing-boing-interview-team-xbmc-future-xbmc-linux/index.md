Freelance writer [Joel Johnson](http://www.joeljohnson.com) recently did and interview with representatives from Team-XBMC for [Boing Boing Gadget blog](https://boingboing.net/tag/gadgets) about the Future of [XBMC for Linux](http://xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Linux_port_project).

 From the interview:  
 [I]“Joel: How close do you feel you are to a stable version of the XBMC for Linux port? (And by stable I mean “easy enough even a jerk like myself could install and run it.”

 Team XBMC: We don’t have a date yet (it is really to early to know), our best guess today is 6-12 months or so from now but it could be longer. As we are a hobby project we depend on developers own personal interest and free time, making it impossible to set an E.T.A., more ‘outside’ developers would sure help speed things along.”[/I]
