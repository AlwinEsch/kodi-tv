[![](/sites/default/files/uploads/logo-lj.jpg "logo-lj")](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/interview-cory-fields-xbmc)After meeting the fine folks from Linux Journal at SCALE this year, we discussed doing an interview to give their readers more insight into the world of XBMC. A few months later Steven Evatt tracked me down for a quick Q/A. See [here](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/interview-cory-fields-xbmc) for the result, and donâ€™t forget to leave any questions you may have for the team in the comments there. They have agreed to a follow-up article if there is sufficient interest.
