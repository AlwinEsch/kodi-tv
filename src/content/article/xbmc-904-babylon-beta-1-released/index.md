Hot on the heals of the [Alpha 1 release,](/xbmc-904-babylon-alpha-1-released "Alpha 1 release") and some 350 code fixes later, the first (and only?) Beta release of [XBMC Media Center 9.04 (codename: Babylon)](https://kodi.tv/milestone/9.04) is now available. New in this Beta 1 release is support for PPC (PowerPC) processors in [XBMC for Mac](https://kodi.wiki/view/XBMC_for_Mac) under Mac OS X (Leopard and Tiger), thanks to [Team-XBMC](/about/team)â€˜s new developer Beenje. The [feature freeze](/xbmc-hits-feature-freeze-for-904) [still applies](/xbmc-hits-feature-freeze-for-904), and we have also branched a [SVN source code tree](https://kodi.wiki/view/Subversion) for release, which means that from here to the end of the month or so we will be only taking well-reviewed fixes in to the final Babylon release. Please give it a run through its paces and [let us know if you have any problems](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO_Submit_a_Proper_Bug_Report). The more testing that is done, the more stable XBMC 9.04 will be!

 XBMC Media Center 9.04 releases for Windows and all Mac OS X platforms may be found [here](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "XBMC downloads").

 The XBMC for Linux (on Ubuntu) release are available [via the PPA on Launchpad](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=49459) as usual.

 Note! If updating from an older version of XBMC you will have to scan in your library again.
