yesterday, an article with the headline “[xbox enthusiasts uncover its versatility](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/a46428-2005jan29.html)” (by daniel greenberg) was posted in [the washington post technology section](www.technews.com). the article basically informs its readers of the potential in unlocking the xbox to install [xboxmediacenter](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com), which makes the versatile xbox into a fully fledged media center, a media center that can playback all common multimedia formats and more than just rival dedicated playback devices, (most which costs more than twice as much as an xbox).

 head over to [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/a46428-2005jan29.html) for the full article.
