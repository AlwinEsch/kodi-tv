To keep with the spirit of breaking things, xbmc.org may be down a bit in the next few days. Not exactly sure when, but it should be within a week. We’re making some changes that should render the site more useful. If you see anything out of the ordinary, don’t fret, if all goes well it should just take an hour or two. Since they’re all tied together this could mean downtime for the forum and wiki too. Obviously we’ll try to keep it minimal, but unforeseen things can (and usually do) happen.

 Please bear with us and our growing pains. The changes should be worth it…

 **Update:** Done!
