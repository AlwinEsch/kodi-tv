microsoft has as of last week (better late news than no news) officially dropped the rrp (recommended retail price) of their [xbox® video game console](https://www.xbox.com/) in europe. the price was lower by £30/€50 making the new rrp £99.99/€149.99, (a price that now match the xbox price in north america which was dropped to $149.99 u.s. in march this year). sony has already followed suit and matched the price drop for their playstation 2. analysts has not yet given their opinion but one can predict that there will now not be another price drop in europe for neither of the two companies video game console until after x-mas.
