October...the month that gave birth to the world's most famous and traditional beer festival. What's possibly better than two weeks of collective beer drinking? Under normal circumstances...probably nothing. In the so called new normal? Let's pretend we can tolerate a bit more of this social awkwardness and find an alternative way: let's just celebrate beer...and open-source. Or in Team Kodi's dictionary: just another month at the office :)

For yet another year, Kodi is participating as a project in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). During the month of October, individuals are invited to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects.  Additionally, Hacktoberfest also promotes several [meetups, virtual events or hackatons](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/events) to celebrate our beloved FOSS. Free swag (or planting a tree with your name if you feel inclined) usually comes to those who are able to finish the challenge (4 **valid** code contributions/pull-requests to eligible repositories) throughout the month of *Hacktober*.

## How to get started?

Head over to the [event website](url) and have a read over the [provided resources](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources). For Kodi, a good starting point is our exhaustive list of [open issues](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues). Team Kodi members (maintainers) will make sure that all the code submissions that take place during the month of October towards our eligible repositories are labeled with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label in case they are valid. Please don't abuse your luck: spam contributions will be tracked and marked invalid, making you ineligible for the competition!
