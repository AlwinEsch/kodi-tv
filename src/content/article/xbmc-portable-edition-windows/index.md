Are there anyone out there who would like to volunteers to help us make “*XBMC Portable*” for us, a PortableApps.com USB Edition of XBMC for Windows?

 [PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com/) works similar to [U3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U3), the main difference is that PortableApps.com is free and open source , and it also works with any with any portable USB Mass Storage Device for Windows (USB flash drive, iPod, portable harddrive, etc) . Checkout the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PortableApps.com) about it.

 The storage device would not be bootable but it would be very cool to do a quick demo of XBMC on any of your friend’s Microsoft Windows computer with it, simply plug-in the USB storage device in any Windows XP or Vista computer and XBMC is ready to be used.

 Discussion about this can be found in the [XBMC Community Forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=33373).
