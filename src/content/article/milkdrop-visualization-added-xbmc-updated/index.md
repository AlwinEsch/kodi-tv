2005-05-15 [milkdrop](https://www.nullsoft.com/free/milkdrop/) was added to xbmc cvs.  
[nullsoft](https://www.nullsoft.com/) kindly opensourced this awesome visualization 2005-05-04, and then it was just a matter of time until one of our devs ported it ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif)

 here’s a screenshot captured using our built-in screenshot function, showing one of the 435 .milk presets currently in our cvs. the screenshot also shows our new seekbar located at top right corner, currently mapped to left-right on the right analog thumbstick.

 [rovastar’s page](http://www.milkdrop.co.uk) is a resource where more than 3000 milkdrop presets can be found.  
 another resource is [winamp’s milkdrop forums](http://forums.winamp.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=81).

 team xbmc would like to thank **ryan geiss** for creating milkdrop, **nullsoft** for opensourcing it, all **preset authors** (too many to list here) and last but not least **mrc** for porting it!
