The new release is out in public. It contains the following notable changes:

 
 *  ATI/AMD Catalyst 8.9
 *  unified hard disk/USB flash disk installer; new in this version is the hard disk installation:  
 
>  - it creates three partitions on the hard disk (boot, fat32 – swap – media, ext3)  
>  - it disables the “root” login (as per Ubuntu standards)  
>  - it asks for the reset of the “xbmc” password
> 
>   
 *  the XBMC profile (userdata, skins, settings, etc) is saved onto the root of the USB flash disk in a directory “dotXBMC” so that it should be easier to add skins and backup settings and library databases
 *  the XBMC log file is saved onto the root of the USB flash disk to ease debugging
 
 Enjoy, and come to the forums to provide feedback!
