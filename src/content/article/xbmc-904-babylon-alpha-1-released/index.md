Just a quick note to let you all know that [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_stage) 1 builds of [XBMC 9.04](http://trac.xbmc.org/milestone/9.04) are now available. New in this release, among many things, is experimental hardware acceleration on Linux via VDPAU for recent NVIDIA graphics chipsets care of motd2k, reworked internal path system to remove dependency on legacy drive letters (meaning [all python scripts and plugins need to be updated to work properly](/article/changes-paths-what-it-means-scripts-and-plugins)), as well as a major bug-fixes for DVD-Video playback care of davilla and phi – so finally those of you on Mac OS X should have working DVD playback too! As usual, many, many bug-fixes for other issues have made their way in, and many more are on the way. Please give it a good going over and [let us know if you have any problems](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO_Submit_a_Proper_Bug_Report). The more testing that’s done, the more stable XBMC 9.04 will be!
