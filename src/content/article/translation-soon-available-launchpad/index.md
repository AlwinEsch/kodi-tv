Good news to all translators out there. rwparris2 (most of the coding) and myself (ideas and small coding) has done a conversion script that allows us to take use of the [i18n](http://download.hforge.org/doc/i18n/index.html) format used on [launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/).

 This script is still in early beta and not open to the public yet. Will post another blogpost and also a forumpost on this when it’s final.

 This ensures us that we will get some more translators to maintain languages and also we might end up with more languages covered. For you as an translator, you have the abillity to choose between the “old way” using [XBMC Translator](https://kodi.wiki/view/XBMC_Translator) or use the nice online translation option on launchpad.net

 If you are activly maintaining a language and want’s to be an “official” translator for that language (meaning that you will activly translate and commit) please feel free to drop me a [mail](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3557595c4141545b754d5758561b5a47520a4640575f505641087a53535c565c5459154147545b465954415a47).
