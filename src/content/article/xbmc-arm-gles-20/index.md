Here’s a quick teaser for those of you who dream of using XBMC on a low-powered ARM platform some day. Our very own McGeagh briefly demonstrates XBMC running on the [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org) using OpenGL ES 2.0 and even manages the obligatory playback of everyone’s favorite: [Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/). This is still in early development and is nowhere near ready for public consumption, but it’s certainly a great step in the right direction. Kudos to McGeagh, keep up the good work.
