xboxmediacenter ([xbmc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/)) is a new free open source (gpl) multimedia player for [microsoft’s xbox](https://www.xbox.com/). xboxmediacenter is still in beta stage but can currently be used to play and view most video/audio/picture formats such as mpeg/mpg, vob, avi, ogm, divx, xvid, mp3, ogg, jpg, gif and many more direct from a cd/dvd in the dvd-rom or of the xbox build-in hard disk drive, it can also play files over a network (lan) from a pc via an “xstream server” application or from a windows (smb) share. it has playlist + slideshow functions as well as the ability to function as a full replacement xbox dashboard. these and more features enables the xbox running xboxmediacenter to fully function as a multi-media jukebox. xboxmediacenter also known as “xbox media center” or simply “xbmc”. 

 this project is what the active official [xbox media player](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de) developers have been working on in secret for the last 4-6 months. this does not mean the [xbox media player](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de) is dead, official and unofficial developers will still be adding new code and maintain it but the lead developers will be focusing on [xbmc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/). remember that xbmc and xbmp are hobby projects and are only developed by volunteers in their spare-time for free.
