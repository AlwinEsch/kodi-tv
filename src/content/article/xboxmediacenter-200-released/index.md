[Team-XBMC](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Team_XBMC_and_Others) and [The XBMC Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/) is proud to announce the release of XboxMediaCenter 2.0.0. [XBox Media Center (XBMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC) is an [award winning](https://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/), free and open source media player for the [Xbox™ game-console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox). The XboxMediaCenter 2.0.0 point-release [source code](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_Is_Source_Code) has now been set in our [CVS](https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87054). We consider that the current code in the [XBMC CVS](https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87054) is as stable as a point-release should be. All XBMC users are highly encouraged to upgrade to this stable Xbox Media Center 2.0.0 point-release. Remember, the XBMC [source code](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_Is_Source_Code) needs to be compiled with the [XDK](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Microsoft_Xbox_SDK), and requires a modded Xbox to run. Our thanks goes out to everyone who has tested, reported bugs, and helped fix them in order to make this release possible.

 There are many new features and functions that have been introduced since the 1.1.0 point-release, that we cannot list them all here. A few that are especially worth mentioning are; the enhanced GUI/skin-engine, the Project Mayhem III skin, DVD-Video menu/navigation support (with ISO/IMG image parsing), RAR/ZIP archive parsing, a new audio/music-player (PAPlayer) with crossfade, gapless playback and ReplayGain support, Karaoke CDG-file display, Xored Trainer Engine (gaming-cheats), XLink Kai (online-gaming) front-end, iTunes 6.x DAAP and UPnP-clients, and two surprise features; read-only support for FAT12/16/32 formatted USB Mass Storage Devices up to 4GB in size, and a brand new “skinnable” 3D visualizer.

 Help is wanted to get our [online-manual (WIKI)](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), and all the [language translations](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=Information_on_Language_Support) up-to-date.
