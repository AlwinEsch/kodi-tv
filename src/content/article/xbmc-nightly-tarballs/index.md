many users have complained that the [anonymous cvs at sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87054)  is unusable. most of the times it’s 24-72 hours behind in updates which can be pretty frustrating. to deliver the latest sources to you guys i have installed a cron job, this job will make a snapshot of the developers cvs every night. 

 update: sorry, but we had to remove the cron job because it got to big (50mb+) and sourceforge.net would not host them because of the bandwith it took. please use wincvs, tortoisecvs or other cvs-client to grab the cvs through the [anonymous cvs access (link)](https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=87054) instead, again we’re sorry.
