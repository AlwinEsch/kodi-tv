Development to port XBMC for Linux to PPC (PowerPC) have begun by third-party developers and source code patches for that is available, however these developers are only focusing on XBMC for Linux, not XBMC for Mac (and no one on Team-XBMC even own a PowerPC based Mac), thus additional third-party developers are needed to port XBMC to PPC so that is can be compiled and run on all PowerPC based Macâ€™s out there.

 For more information please see these threads in the XBMC forum [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=34439), [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=32320), [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=35435), and [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=36229).

 Are there any C++ programmers out there who owns a PPC Mac yourselves and might be interested in this?
