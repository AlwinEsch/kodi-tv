What a way to kick off the new year with the release of Camelot and then the flurry of skins released thereafter. It’s time I join in on the release frenzy and add Rapier 3.0 to the mix. It’s been awhile since the last update and the changes are too numerous to list so it’s best to check out the [changelog](/skins/rapier/2) or [this thread](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=65889) which highlights some of the more notable changes/features accompanied with screenshots. Some people have expressed worry that Xbox users would be left behind with the latest Camelot release but I’m happy to report Rapier 3.0 has no problems and runs smoothly as of SVN rev25497. Head over to the dedicated Rapier 3.0 release [thread](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=65895) if you’d like to share your thoughts and/or have specific questions.

 **Update:** Version 3.06 has been released which replaces the problematic fonts. CPU usage should be back to normal, check the download link for the latest version.
