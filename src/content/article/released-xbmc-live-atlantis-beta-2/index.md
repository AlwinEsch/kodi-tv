XBMC Live Atlantis Beta2 has been released and is available at [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/files/ "Atlantis beta2")!

 Main changes since last release:

 * updated NVIDIA drivers, 177.78  
 * enhanced XBMC Live creator, with bug fixes and new functionality such as install to hard disk. **WARNING: THE CHOSEN DISK (HARD DISK or FLASH DISK) WILL BE COMPLETELY ERASED!** I say it again:**WARNING: THE CHOSEN DISK (HARD DISK or FLASH DISK) WILL BE COMPLETELY ERASED!**

 Updated AMD/ATI drivers could not get through this time, they will be ready for next release â€“ or even earlier than that as a separate package.

 Oh yes, new bugs, too! Tell us about them in the [forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=81 "XBMC Live Forum")!
