It was mentioned a few days ago that [things might get bumpy for a while](/team-xbmc/2009/08/27/impending-merge-likely-temporary-breakage) and a few of you asked to be notified when all the fun was starting. Well, consider yourselves notified.

 As of svn rev #22529 the branch has been merged into main. Please be patient as we get things back in line. And again, we ask that you hold off on bug reports and nightly builds until the codebase has stabilized. **We know itâ€™s broken**.

 **Update**: PPA Users: r22746 has accidentally made its way into the SVN PPA. Please DO NOT upgrade for the reasons listed above. We will remove this revision as soon as possible.

 **Update 2**: SVN PPA is now fixed.
