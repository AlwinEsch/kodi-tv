With the upcoming Atlantis release, we would like to ask for international users to help out by translating XBMC into your language or if itâ€™s already translated, review and improve the current translation.

 **Deadline for submitting these translations is the 25th of october.**

 These two english languagefiles need translation:  
[English for XBMC](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/xbmc/svn/)  
[English for PM3.HD](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/xbmc/svn/)

 [Here](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/xbmc/svn/) are you can download the XBMC languagefiles.  
 And [here](http://svn.code.sf.net/p/xbmc/svn/) are the languagefiles for PM3.HD

 There are a some help on the [wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Information_on_Language_Support)

 Also there are an nice application to aid you in translation called [XBMC Translator](https://kodi.wiki/view/XBMC_Translator)

 Discuss this, ask questions and make suggestions in [this](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=39158) forumthread.
