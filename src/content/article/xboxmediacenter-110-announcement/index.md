xbmc 1.1.0 final point release source code has now been set in our cvs! once again we felt that we had been holding off doing any official release candidates for so long that we now consider the current xbmc cvs to be as stable as a point release should and could be, so we decided that we were ready to go final without a release candidate process. yes, there are still a few [known bugs](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=87054&atid=581838) but none serious enough to stop you from fully using and enjoying xbmc. all xbmc users (and xbmp users if there still are any?) are highly encouraged to upgrade to this stable xbox media center 1.1.0 point release which is now officially the only supported version. for those of you who are new to xbmc (and/or xbmp) please understand and respect that team-xbmc do not release nor distribute xbox executables (xdk binaries) at all, so please do not ask us where to find/download a compiled versions of xbmc (which you do require to run xbmc on your xbox). please read through our [faq](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_faq.htm) and the [online-manual](http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de) carefully before posting/asking anything in our [official xbmc community-forums](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl). know that the official cvs feature/skin freeze has now been lifted, meaning our [team-devs](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/more_team.htm) are again allowed to add new features/functions to the xbmc cvs, and [independent programmers can too (link)](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_faq.htm#31). we would also love if people would go ahead with [updating/translating the 1.1.0 strings.xml to other languages](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_faq.htm#translations) and help updating our [online-line (wikki) user-manual (link)](http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de).

 finally, we like to remind you all that [the xbmc project relies on your donations for its survival](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/info_contrib.htm)!
