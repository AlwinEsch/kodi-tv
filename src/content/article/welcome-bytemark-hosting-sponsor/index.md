![logo](/sites/default/files/uploads/logo.gif "logo")Lately the XBMC project has picked up a few new sponsors. Others will be announced as we begin taking advantage of their services.

 First on the list is [Bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/). See them in our footer down there? They have been nice enough to give us a fancy server at their hosting facility in Manchester for us to use as we please. It’s our first utility server, and we plan on loading it up with [buildbot](http://buildbot.net/) which should help us with compiling various platforms (if you’ve ever built XBMC you know that it’s a very time-consuming operation). We’ll probably find some more uses for it down the road, who knows?

 Thanks again to Bytemark. We (and the community no doubt) appreciate the generosity.
