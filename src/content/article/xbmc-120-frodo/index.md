 A Shout Out to Our Friends and Sponsors
---------------------------------------

 With this release, we’d like to single out a few friends and sponsors who went a very long ways to make Frodo a reality.

 To start, we’ve added two entirely new users bases with Frodo. The first was the Raspberry Pi platform. It’s rare when a registered charity can do something as incredible as create a piece of hardware that’s got thousands of people salivating. It’s absolutely unheard of when that piece of hardware pops out as the single least expensive means of running XBMC ever. Thanks to the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/ "The Raspberry Pi Foundation") for their efforts and their support!

 The second new platform is XBMC for Android. The simple fact of the matter is, XBMC for Android might not exist as a working port right now if it weren’t for the decision of [Pivos Technology](https://www.pivosgroup.com/ "Pivos Technology") to employ two XBMC Team members fulltime to make it happen. Of course, countless other Team Members and non-Team coders have contributed to the code base both before and after that initial decision, but it was Pivos who gave our developers the necessary man hours to make XBMC for Android a reality.

 In addition, in an unheralded move, Pivos has gone above and beyond the standard sponsor requirements and [donated enough XIOS DS](https://www.pivosgroup.com/ "The XIOS DS")‘s to the Foundation so that every current XBMC Team member, regardless of skill set (from developers to wiki maintainers to testers), has or will have an Android device to tinker with and test things out on.

 Finally, there are the friends and sponsors who provide all the data that makes XBMC what it is, including [TheTVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com/ "TheTVDB"), [TheMovieDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/ "The Movie Database"), [Fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv/ "fanart.tv"), and [TheAudioDb](https://theaudiodb.com/ "The Audio DB"), among so many others. In particular, we’d like to acknowledge [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/ "Weather Underground") who stepped in to rescue XBMC when we lost our last weather host and also [WebHostingBuzz](https://www.webhostingbuzz.com/ "WebHostingBuzz") and [Bytemark Hosting](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/ "Bytemark Hosting"), the webservers who make XBMC.org possible.

 Thanks to you all!
