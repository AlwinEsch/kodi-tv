we are looking for new developers who want to help us develop xbmc. we are getting more feature-requests/bugs-reports every day and currently we do not have enough developers/time to fulfil them all. with more developers working on xbmc we are hoping to speed things up and get more bugs fixed, new features added in shorter time.

 so if (and only if) you’re interested in helping developing xbmc then please reply [to this thread (link)](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?act=st;f=1;t=892;r=1), we’ll leave this thread running for a week or so and then make a selection (or choose all) from those interested.
