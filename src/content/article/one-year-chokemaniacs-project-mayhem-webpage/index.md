quote from [chokemaniac.net](http://www.chokemaniac.net):

 i’ve come a long way ![:)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_smile.gif) many things happened in the past 12 months. when i started this site, i only wanted a couple of screenshots of the project mayhem skin and a download button. but **critikill** made soo much more out of it. thanks a lot out to you bud. hope your current projects are going well.   
 a couple of weeks ago the new design was launched and i have t say i really love it. big props out to **christian granqvist** again for coding it for me! the latest addition is the new project mayhem forum. **modhack**, **alexsolex** and **chris** made it almost alone and i cant thank them enough. i hope all the skinners out there will join me there to take xbmc skinning to the next level.   
 i also worked a lot on xbmc with (my favorite coder ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif)**jonathan marshall**. we came up with many nice additions like submenu, contextmenus, shutdownmenu, the new slideshow, new filemanager and the new settings system. and i think we’re gonna keep improving xbmc. i’m looking forward to it. big props to you too j. and thanks for you patience with me ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif)  
 by now i released more than 20 skins for all kinds of xbox apps. more than 110.000 downloads so far and counting. not too bad i think. project mayhem iii is around the corner now. i planed to release it today but i’m not completely happy with it yet. so guess you gotta be patient a little longer. i think this will be my last skin for xbmc. i’ts a lot of work to keep 3 skins up to date. but anyways: i’ll keep suprising ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif)
