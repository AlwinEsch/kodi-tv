The first task I’ve taken up for the next release of XBMC is to clean up our build system. As it stands now, XBMC is a hassle to build on any Linux distrobution except Ubuntu. This is mostly the fault of our configure and Makefiles not conforming to expected standards. I’d also like to get our Mac release to build using configure/make as well. Since I’m not autoconf expert, I started doing some research. The first thing I stumbled upon was the Gnits Standards. Wow, they’ve thought of everything! It’s time to jump down the rabbit hole and see where this takes me. If you’re interested in learning more about the GNU build system, you may want to take a look as well: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnits\_Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnits_Standards).
