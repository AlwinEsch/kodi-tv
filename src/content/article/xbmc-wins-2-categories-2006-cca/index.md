2006 sourceforge.net community choice awards  
[we won!](https://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/) 

 thanks to you – our users, [xbmc](http://www.xboxmediacenter.com) won best multimedia and also best game(!) category.  
 prize: ‘bragging rights’ and the logo on our [projectpage](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbmc/).

 and while i have your attention, we are in need of assistance to get our [wiki manual](http://manual.xboxmediacenter.com) “up to speed” for the upcoming 2.0.0 release. loto is attempting a rewrite, but he is in need of assistance. documenting xbmc is simply too much for 1 individual to handle, see [discussion](http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de/wakka.php?wakka=discussionv2)

 also don’t forget, we will not be including outdated translations with 2.0.0, so if your language isn’t uptodate, please make an effort to update your language!
