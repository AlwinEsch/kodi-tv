the xbmc (xbox media center) project unfortunately missed the sign up for this years “[google summer of code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/2008/?csw=1)“, however if you have c language programming skills then you can still contribute indirectly by [signing up for this years google summer of code](http://code.google.com/soc/student_step1.html) and [assisting the ffmpeg project](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/Ffmpeg_summer_of_code). google is sponsoring their second summer of code which rewards students with stipends of up to us$4500 to develop open source software, and ffmpeg is one of the qualified projects this year. [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/index.php) is an audio/video conversion tool which includes libavcodec the leading open source codec library. [xbmc uses ffmpeg as its main audio/video decoder library](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?act=st;f=4;t=1921), and the great thing about ffmpeg is that is supports most operating-system platforms (like windows, linux/unix and mac) so you don’t need to have microsoft visual studio or the xdk (or even an xbox) to contribute, you only need a computer and some time/willpower. the student application period closes monday, may 8, so hurry up and sign up.
