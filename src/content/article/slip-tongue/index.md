Thought I should slip my tongue a bit… Been working on a new installer script that will replace xbmcscripts.com installer. This new one will be a total addons manager, meaning:  
 * install/uninstall of addons – plugins, scripts, skins (to start with, later on maybe extend it to skinmods, soundpacks, iconpacks, etc)  
 * easy downloading of addons  
 * updating of addons thru the manager  
 * no need for a computer to install addons  
 Been working on the backend today and made really good progress, solving a few issues.

 1: Handling categories of scripts (this was a pain with xbmcscripts installer, since it was hardcoded)  
 2: Improved transfer speed of addons list (estimated numbers)  
 * uncompressed size of list: 85000bytes, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
