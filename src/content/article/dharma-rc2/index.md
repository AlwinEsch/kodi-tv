Dharma RC2 is ready, and this one is a Release Candidate in the truest sense. There are a few reasons we decided to do one last pre-release:

 
 * Shoutcast support has been redone. Listening to your favorite online radio stations with the shoutcast plugin is now a much nicer experience.
 * The add-ons moved out of the testing repository and into their permanent home. This means that everyone will **need to upgrade** in order to see future add-on updates. If you continue to use RC1 or previous, please donâ€™t report a lack of updates.
 * Automatic updates for add-ons are now enabled by default. Of course, you can still disable them via the add-on manager if you prefer.
 
 It has been far too long already, so the final release of Dharma should be close behind this one. If you have any outstanding issues speak now or forever hold your peace!
