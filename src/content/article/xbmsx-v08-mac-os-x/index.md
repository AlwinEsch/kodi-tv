xbmsx v0.8 is now available, (xbmsx by -rx- is a xbmp/xbmc xstream server for mac os x). from the readme: *“i recompiled the binary with frodo’s xbmc-compatibility-patch, and this seems to have gotten rid of some directory browsing problems i was having with xbmc and xbmsx v0.7. it also seems (on initial tests) to be compatible with xbmp and panther.”*
