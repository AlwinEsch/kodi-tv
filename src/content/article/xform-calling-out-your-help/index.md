from arddrive of [xform.xbox-scene.com](http://xform.xbox-scene.com): “hi everyone, arddrive here at xform. i am please to announce that xform [an xbmc skinning tool] is now open source and i am looking for .net c# programmers to help work on xform to work on custom objects and fun stuff like that (you will need a good knowledge but not need to be an expert because i can always check your code). i’m also looking for people who are willing to write a manual in html for xform. this will be complied into one big free html manual with help from others. if you are interested in joining the xform dev team drop me an email at gutterdrive -at- hotmail.com to chat about things.”
