we have decided to postpone the last submission date of our xbmc skinning contest by one month, this mostly due to the few number of skins submitted so far. postponing the contest means new skinners will get a chance to catch up to join the competition and all existing skinners get to perfect the final touches of their entries, or perhaps even create another skin for xboxmediacenter? again, the prizes on stake is 20 xenium modchips provided by [team-ozxodus](http://www.ozxodus.com) and [xbox-gear.com](https://www.xbox.com/). the final submission date is now 20th of june 2004, so go ahead and get skinning!

 non-skinners, please [make a donation](https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=erwin_beckers@hotmail.com&no_shipping=1&item_name=xbmc+skin+contest+donation) to help pay for the winners modchip shipping cost.
