cykiller from [maxconsole.com](https://www.maxconsole.com/) responding to xbmcâ€™s [buy frodo a dreamx-733 campaign](http://www.xboxmediaplayer.de/cgi-bin/forums/ikonboard.pl?act=st;f=1;t=2552;) offered a very generous donation, a [dreamx-1480](http://upgrade123.com/catalog/product_info.php?cpath=32&amp;products_id=65) to frodo for further development of the xboxmediacenter project. the [dreamx-1480](http://upgrade123.com/catalog/product_info.php?cpath=32&amp;products_id=65) by [friendtech](http://www.friendtech.com) is a modified xbox running on 1.4ghz cpu and 128mb ram, it also has built-in spdif optical output (for dolby digital 5.1 surround sound). other donations we received so far and future donations will of course still be used to further xbmc development. few things on our list are digital-receiver for testing ac3/dtc digital passthrough, and a [x2vga](http://www.x2vga.com) for hdtv debugging (on vga monitors). so donations are still more than welcomed and needed.

 a huge thanks goes to cykiller and [maxconsole.com](https://www.maxconsole.com/) for their generous donation, thank you!
