Our very own [Scott Davilla](https://kodi.tv/davilla) and [Jonathan Marshall](https://kodi.tv/jmarshall) were recently interviewed by Leo Laporte and Randall Schwartz for the show [FLOSS Weekly](https://twit.tv/floss) on [TWiT.tv](https://twit.tv/)

 The recorded show is now available for download, or for streaming from <https://twit.tv/floss57>, so pop over there and hear Scott and Jonathan discuss XBMC (among other things) with Leo and Randall.

 Enjoy!
