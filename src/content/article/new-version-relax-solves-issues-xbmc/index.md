relax v0.79

 # relax now works with xbmc!….. if you don’t use xmbc then don’t download this release  
 # just put in xbmc the path like “xns://yourip:1400/” for the root and “xns://yourip:1400/divx” for your divxes.. etc  
 # here is the changelog!  
 * relax now works with xbmc.. to do that i had to rework the internal file system. that’s why the following doesn’t work anymore.  
 - disabled iso support  
 - disabled xiso support  
 - disabled zip support  
 - disabled shoutcast support  
 - disabled intergrating directorys  
 - disabled directory flattening  
 + filesize reporting  
 + filedate reporting  
 * fixed the filelister reporting incorrect filesizes!  
 * xbmc scan’s for thumbs for each directory.. thats why it’s a bit slow when entering a directory with loads of directory’s.  
 * when u disable logging… directory changing in xbmc will become faster.  
 - some other stuff might now be broken. just mail me and i’ll see what i can do. 

 # when i have some spare time i’ll try to rebuild some options again in the v0.xx branch before going back to work on the rebuild again.
