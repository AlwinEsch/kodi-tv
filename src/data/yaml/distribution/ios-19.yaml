    description: >-
      These development builds, often called “pre-release” builds, are what will
      eventually lead to the final version. **THESE BUILDS ARE UNSTABLE** and
      are for users that do not fear bugs or possibly crashes. If you want a
      stable HTPC then please install a stable build instead. ***Always backup
      before using a development build.***


      **Snapshots** are semi-stable nightly snapshots of the current development version. They are a step between (often) unstable nightly builds and stable release builds, though they can sometimes still be a bit unstable.


      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should only be used for to help us find possible issues.


      Be sure to read the following pages before trying these out: [Development builds](http://kodi.wiki/view/development_builds), [Quality assurance testing](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Help_with_quality_assurance_testing), and [How to submit a bug report](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Submit_a_bug_report).
